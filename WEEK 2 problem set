ANS1-  Both algorithms might fail to compute a maximum-weight acyclic subgraph. 
ANS2-  both algorithms compute a maximum-cost spanning tree of  G, but they might compute different ones.
Ans3:- The algorithm always outputs a minimum spanning tree.
Ans4:- A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is not always a minimum spanning tree, but a minimum spanning tree is always a minimum bottleneck spanning tree.
Ans5:- All options are the answers.
